# Automatic-car-park-with-sms-alert
This is a modern park that uses RFID system to grant users access into the park. When a user with an unauthorized or expired or irrelevant card tries to access the park, it sends an SMS to the park owner via twilio or GSM module. The park owner is also able to know how many cars accessed his park at the end of each day from his mobile app.
